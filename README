README

Here's a readme. Just for test.

But one thing could be declared. This repo contains a blog written with the help of Sinatra and obviously Ruby. Wait for changes. Currently I don't have much skills in coding though I hope someday I would be experienced enough to build complex apps and so on. Thanks for reading.
